    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,<br><br> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's 
        science faculty to study as part <br> of your <span style="text-decoration: none;
        border-bottom: 1px dotted;">PhD </span> next year, I will answer your questions one by one, 
        in the following sections.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Starting dates</h1>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
         could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows</p>
         <ul style="left: 40px;">
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
         </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br><br>
        You can find more information about important university dates on our website</p>

    <h1>Subjects of study</h1>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility as long as the subjects fall <br>
         somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
       thedoftoning of the wood p person we'd on our team. ideas you submitted by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
       <ol style="left: 40px;">
        <li> Turning H₂O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (CH203)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bussplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
             midience size exponentially increases  (effect of 3 x 10<sub>3</sub>  increasing to 3 x 104.) </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: none;
            border-bottom: 1px dotted;"><strong> Html</strong></span> and <span style="text-decoration: none;
        border-bottom: 1px dotted;"><strong> Css</strong></span>constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
       </ol>
    <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
      research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks</p>

    <h1>Exotic dance moves</h1>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
         my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance </p> <p style=" position: relative; left: 40px;"> A litle known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>
         in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle </p> <p style=" position: relative; left: 40px;"> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
          involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
           tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
            modern styles such as Twerking.</p>    
    <p>Arctic robot dance </p> <p style=" position: relative; left: 40px;">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
         discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
          of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
        because they were really cold.</p>
        
    <p> For more of my research, see my <a href="https://www.ptcdb.edu.ps">exotic dance research page</a> </p>    
    <p>Yours sincerely. <br><br>
